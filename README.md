## My Fluffy Friend

Build a platform that connects animal shelters and rescue organizations with potential adopters. Users can search for pets, learn about their personalities, and apply for adoption.

# User Story

As a potential pet adopter, I want to easily search for pets available for adoption on the platform, so that I can find the perfect companion for my family.

# Acceptance Criteria


When I land on the platform's homepage, I should see a prominently displayed search bar that allows me to search for pets.

I can choose to search for pets based on various criteria, including species (e.g., dogs, cats, rabbits), breed, age, size, and location (e.g., within a specific radius of my zip code).

The search results should be displayed in a clear and organized manner, showing each pet's name, a thumbnail image, brief description, and a button to view more details.

When I click on a pet's name or the "View Details" button in the search results, I should be taken to a dedicated pet profile page with more information about the pet, including its age, breed, gender, personality traits, health status, and location.

When I click the "Apply for Adoption" button, I should be directed to a user-friendly adoption application form. This form should request necessary information such as my name, contact details, living situation, and preferences for pet care.

The platform should provide clear and easily accessible contact information for the animal shelters or rescue organizations, including their phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses, in case I need to reach out for additional information or assistance.

# Definition of Done


The search functionality is fully functional and returns accurate results based on the specified criteria.
The pet profile pages are populated with comprehensive and up-to-date information about each pet.
The adoption application form is user-friendly and captures all necessary information.
Users receive timely email confirmations after submitting adoption applications.
The user profile dashboard accurately displays the status of adoption applications.
Contact information for shelters and rescue organizations is up to date and easily accessible on the platform.
Note: Additional user stories and features could be added to enhance the platform further, such as user registration, user reviews, integration with social media platforms, and more.
